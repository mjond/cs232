Project 5: Client-Server Computing

I, the undersigned, affirm that the submitted project is
the work of myself and no one else.


NAME:  Mark Davis mjd85

I tried to get as much done with the tutorials and Google searching but 
this is as far as I got without going past the due date. And I have 
exams to study for and other projects to finish.
