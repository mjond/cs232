Process Synchronization Answers

1. Does your program run the same way each time? Why?

No, the program does not run the same way each time because the threads are in race conditions and will race differently each time the program is run.

2. Give your last customer thread the highest priority. Does this ensure that this customer is always given first priority? Why or why not?

No, the highest priority given to the last customer thread does not ensure that this customer is always given first priority. Some higher priority threads can wait behind a lower priority thread if the lower thread holds a lock/semaphore that the higher priority thread is waiting for.
